# Problem & its Solution

- Error: ...
  As of Jest 28 "jsdom" is no longer shipped by default, make sure to install it separately.

`npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom`

# Info

- eslint-plugin-testing-library@5.6.3 = Helps to debug
  `screen.debug()` So, this is a console log. Brings out all the dom.

## npx mrm@2 lint-staged

Every time we commit now, it'll do the prettier for us as well as the linting fixes.
